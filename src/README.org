* README
** TODO convert the index files
** Canonical sequences
   * come from CARD website
   * comes in a simple fasta format
   * converted directly to an index
   * and fasta with unique integers like lcl|canon|12
** Prevalence Sequences
   * come from CARD website protein homolog file
   * fasta format similar to Canonical sequences
# nope   * grep for the relevant protein to new fasta
   * first makeblastdb the fasta
   * blast the new db
   * convert the blast results to unique taking the max length sequence from
     each identical query
   * blast file serves as index for
   * extract fasta from those blast results
** Non-redundant NCBI sequences
   * come from ncbi as an existing blast database
   * blast this from the references
   * convert the blast results to unique taking the max length sequence from
   * blast file serves as index for
   * extract fasta from those blast results
** UBAs
   * come from rgi-card output
   * are in seperate text files
   * make an index from the raw txt files
   * make a fasta from that
   * blastdb that fasta
   * blast that db
   * make unique the blast
   * extract the fasta
